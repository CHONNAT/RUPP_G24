*** Learn Objective ***


*** Learn Outcome ***

*** Software Engineering Overwiew ***
. Software = code + libraries + docs
.A program = is an executable
.engineering = well-definded, scientific principles, methods
.Software enginnering = developing software product using engineering mechanism.

*** then what is software engineering in current situation ***


*** Software Engineering evolution ***
. Software Evolution
- Change Rquest
- Impact Analysis
- Release Planning
-System update
-System Release


*** Software Evolution Law ***
. Prof. Manny Lehman (1974)
1. Static-type (S-type)
. Continuing change
. Increasing complexity
. Conservation of familiarity
. Continuing growth
.Reducing queality
.Feedback systems
.Self-regulation
.Organizational stability

2. Practical-type (P-type)
3. Embedded-type (E-type)

Q: if the a software do not used?

*** Characteristice of good software ***
1. Operational:
. Budget: maney
. Usability : using
. Efficiency : no complane, easy using, 
. Correctness : responding
. Functionality : nessery, តម្រូវការ
.Dependability : safety, 
.Security​ 
2. Transitional
.Portablility
.Interoperability
.Reusability
.Adaptability
3. Maintenance
.Modularity : decomposable
.Maintainability : modifiable
.Flexibility : changeable
.Scalability : growable

*** Why Software is so expensive ***
* Software is expensive!
* The major costs are salaries 
* More and more demand from clients

* Every software project has a trade-off between:
1. Functionalit
2. Resoureces (cost)
3. TimeLinsess : good apartunity of relaxing

. Hardware Cost Vs Software Cost?
- Software is cost than hardware

.Frequently asked questions about software enineering

- 
- systems > software
- 1. dependincy of customers, 2. time duration 3. softly software and good quelity
- develop: 60%, Testing: 40%
- no a software that is expert
- 
- deverent of prgrammer and software engineer
