*** Learn Objective ***


*** Learn Outcome ***

*** Software Engineering Overwiew ***
. Software = code + libraries + docs
.A program = is an executable
.engineering = well-definded, scientific principles, methods
.Software enginnering = developing software product using engineering mechanism.

*** then what is software engineering in current situation ***


*** Software Engineering evolution ***
. Software Evolution
- Change Rquest
- Impact Analysis
- Release Planning
-System update
-System Release


*** Software Evolution Law ***
